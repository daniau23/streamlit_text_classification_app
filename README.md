## **Text Classification App**

- This app makes use of the models built in a current project repo [amazon_sentiment](https://github.com/daniau23/amazon_sentiment.git) for Streamlit deployment. 
- The project makes use of Word2Vec, Doc2Vec and word embeddings  text representation for the purpose of text classification.

    - numpy==1.23.1
    - scipy==1.9.0
    - matplotlib==3.5.3
    - gensim==4.2.0
    - python==3.8/3.8.13/3.9 (kindly use 3.9 for deployment as that's what works on Streamlit)
    - seaborn==0.11.2
    - tensorflow==2.11.0 (*Finally, the deep learning approach has been done.*)
